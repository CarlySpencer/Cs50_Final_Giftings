Description: A website to store your friends and family's interests as well as any events they may celebrate. When those events come around, the user can view thier friends and family's interests and get ideas for possible gifts for them. This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, SQL, Flask, and Bootstrap.

To use the site, the user must register and then login. 

The homepage displays the current date and displays the name, birthday, and any notes of people you have registered. A select menu can be used to select a single registered person and view all of the events they celebrate as well as a list of their interests.

The add person page allows the user to register people. The form asks for thier name, birthday, and any additional notes the user may want to add. These entries show up in a table below. Users can edit the information as needed.

The add events page allows the user to select previously registered people and assign events to them. These events along with their dates will show up in a table below and can be deleted if the user chooses.

The add interests page allows the user to select a regisered person and give interests to them. There is an assortment of checkboxes to choose from or the user can input a custom interest. Again, there is a table below where the user can delete entries. 

The shop page is a list of links that is meant to help users start looking for gift ideas.
